# Outline

## Day 1 - Concepts and Overview
Get the machine going ASAP, and the kids making. Need to think of a good
and democratic way of doing this. Probably get a few prints for each kid to
take home and do one on-site.

Questions to answer:
* What is 3D printing?
* Who uses 3D printing?
* What can you make with 3D Printing?
* Why would you use 3D printing?
* When did 3D printing start?
* How do you make something for a 3D Printer? --> use remaining time to
explore tinkercad and blockscad.

Ideas:
* Illustrate paths with cardboard strips
* Draw a picture with string and thumbtacks?

Props:
* XYZ axes --> 3D! (Why do we call it 3D printing)


## Day 2 - Design principles in general and for 3D Printing

https://www.tinkercad.com/

Questions to answer:
* What is 3D modeling?
* What are the constraints of a 3D printer?


Props:
* Overhangs (maybe just stack cardboard until it tips)
* Support material?
* "stroke" width?

## Day 3 - Steps to making the machine move

Start by asking them to think of a question that they will write down at the end of
class. We will answer them next class.

Questions to answer:
* What is "slicing"?

Need to ask for Jack's slides on slicing steps from JuliaCon, they were gold.
